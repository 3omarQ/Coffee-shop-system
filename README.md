# Coffee Shop System

A **cash register system** designed for a caf√© that offers society games charged by time.

## Features

- **Order Management**: 
  - Enter an order, and a timer starts counting. If the clients wish to play, the total price is calculated based on the time spent.
  
- **Printing Functionalities**:
  - Print the order for both the Barista and the Client.
  - Print the total revenue of the day.
  
- **Saving Functionalities**:
  - Saves the order list in an Excel sheet, with files organized by day and month.
  - Automatically saves each session, ensuring that in case of an accidental program closure, the orders of that day are still retrieved.
